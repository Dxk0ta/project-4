# BLOOM
BLOOM is an app made to help users gain more knowledge on the plants they own (or plants in general) and give tips and notification to remind the user when to care for their plants and what kind of care to give them!

Github link: https://github.com/Dxk0ta/Project-4.git

## Getting started
I started by thinking out the app and making sure it would be something do able. Once I got a good idea of how the user expireince would play out, I started working out the ERD charts, RESTFUL routing charts, and wireframe. I wanted to make sure the app would have a good user expierence.

---

### MVP Goals
---
* Make sure there is a good user expierence and clear understanding of the app.
* Set up plant API to retrieve data for user.
* Display a details page for a specific plant.
* Allow user to add plant to their garden.

---

### Stretch Goals
---
* Auth
* Creating notifications for specific plants care when its needed
* Add weather API give care notifications based on the weather in your area and what your plants need in that weather.
* "Gallery page" kind of like a blog where you can post pictures and posts about plants
* Let users interact on users gallery pages
* Add acheivments and metals as a reward system for caring for your plant when you get a notification.

### Potential Road Blocks
---
I am very excited but pretty nervous to use Vue. I just started a crash course on it but theres always expected road blocks while learning and implamenting something new. While I'm expecting to hit those road blocks with this, I'm excited to learn and code through them to learn this new technology.

## The Process of BLOOM
---
(DAY ZERO)

What I did:

* I thought through what I wanted the user expirence to be like and the steps that would have to be taken to get there. I made sure I could find an API that would work. I will be using the plants API from Perenual (https://perenual.com/user/developer). After I made sure this was thought though well and could pan out, I started working on the wireframe, ERDs, and RESTFUL routing charts.

(DAY ONE)

What the plan is:

* After (hopefully) getting approved I would like to start working on the authentication connected and implamented on my landing page, routes, and getting the API inserted and rendering data onto the screen.

(DAY TWO)

What the plan is:

* If I sucessfully got to implamenting the API, my next step would be to start on the details page and add a button that adds the flowers they choose to their garden. I will also need to make sure that the data the user is searching is saving to the database.

What I did today:

(DAY THREE)

What the plan is:

* Then I can go to working on making the notifications and implamenting them into the code.

(DAY FOUR)

What the plan is:

* If I am all caught up with my plan at this point, I will start on setting up basic CSS and getting things looking a little better. I would like to start messing around at this point and see what I can break and figure out what bugs need fixing.

What I did today:

* 

---
(DAY FIVE)

What the plan is:

* If everything is running smoothly and there are no bugs, I would use this time to start looking over what I have and how I can make it a better user expirence, and then I would start on my stretch goals

What I did today:

* 

---
(DAY SIX)

What the plan is:

* The plan it to use day six to continuting working on my stretch goals. Setting up comments, getting users to talk to eachother on there "gallery" page and users can search other users, along with make posts themselves.

What I did today:

* 

--- 
(DAY SEVEN)

What the plan is:

* This day will be used specifically for polishing, fixing bugs, styling, and making sure the app is ready for deployment. I will be deploying on the end of this day.
